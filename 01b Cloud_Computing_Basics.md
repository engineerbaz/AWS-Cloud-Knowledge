# Cloud Computing Basics
------------------------
Before moving to Cloud, we need to know HyperVisior 

## HyperVisior (VM)
Piece of Computer software, firmware or hardware that creates & runs VM

There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as “Type 1” (or “bare metal”) and “Type 2” (or “hosted”). 
- A type 1 hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host’s hardware
  - Zen Server, 
  - ESXi(VMware), 
  - HyperV (MS), 
  - Citrix, KVM (OpenSource)
  
- A type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.
  - For Testing purposes
  - Install on OS (Windows 10/ /Linux)
    - Oracle VirtualBox
    - VMware Work Station 
    - MS Virtual PC
    - HyperV (MS)

### Host Machine & Guest Machine
A Computer on which a HyperVisior runs one or more VMs called Host Machine 
Each VM is called Guest Machine

#### Issues with Servers
No efficient utilization of resources (CPU, Memory), Most of the time resources were being wasted.

#### Issues with VMs
For any upgrade in resources all VMs should be turn off 

## Virtualization
Act of creating a virtual version of something (OS, Storage, network)

## Cloud Computing
- Using on-demand Computing resources outside your premises
- Includes 
  - compute - Cluster HV
  - network - Router Switch
  - DB - Database
  - Storage - NAS , DAS

## Advantages & Characteristics of Cloud Computing

**- on-demand**
  - Avalailble when needed 
- No SPOF
  - No Single Point of Failure
- Scalable 
  - Verticle - adding capacity in existing resources
  - Horizontal - adding more resources
- PAYG
  - Pay As You Go ( Pay what you use )
- Agile 
  - Go global in minutes 
  - Can be live in different locations 
- HA  
  - High Avalailblity related to Server
  - Durable related to Storage (SSD)
- Secure
  - Of the Cloud = Physical security
  - In the Cloud =  Securing cloud you made

# Type of cloud
- Public 
  - 
    - AWS, Google, AliBaba, Azure 
- Private 
  - Made in your Datacenter for use or selling
